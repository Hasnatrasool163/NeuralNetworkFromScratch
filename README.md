This code initializes and trains a neural network to recognize and predict ASCII characters. The network uses leaky ReLU activation functions for its hidden layers and softmax for the output layer. It incorporates L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and utilizes backpropagation for training.

# Deep Neural Network for Character Recognition

This project develops a deep neural network (DNN) capable of recognizing and predicting ASCII characters. The network is trained on a synthetic dataset generated from one-hot encoded ASCII characters, allowing it to learn the representation of each character.

## Features

- **Leaky ReLU Activation:** Utilizes the leaky ReLU activation function for hidden layers to help prevent the dying ReLU problem.
- **Softmax Output Layer:** Employs a softmax activation function in the output layer for multi-class classification.
- **L2 Regularization:** Incorporates L2 regularization to reduce overfitting by penalizing large weights.
- **Backpropagation:** Updates model weights and biases using the backpropagation algorithm.
- **Model Save/Load:** Allows saving and loading the model weights to/from a file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- numpy
- os
- pickle

## Usage

1. **Generate Data:** Synthetic data for training is generated automatically.
2. **Initialize Network:** The network is initialized with predefined layers and parameters.
3. **Train Network:** Train the network using the generated data.
4. **Test Network:** After training, test the network's predictions on ASCII characters.
5. **Save/Load Model:** Optionally, save or load the model weights for future use.

```python
# Initialize the network
nn = DeepNeuralNetwork(layers=[95, 128, 64, 95], learning_rate=0.01, lambda_reg=0.001)

# Train the network
nn.train(X, Y, epochs=5000)

# Test the network
test_all_characters(nn, test_characters)

Customization
Layers and Neurons: You can customize the network architecture by adjusting the number of layers and neurons.
Learning Rate and Regularization: Adjust the learning rate and lambda regularization parameter as needed.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: How do I change the characters set the network can recognize?
A: Modify the test_characters string in the main function to include the characters you wish to recognize.

Q: How long does training take?
A: Training time depends on your system's capabilities and the specified epochs. Typically, a few minutes for 5000 epochs on a modern CPU.

Q: Can I use this model for recognizing characters in images?
A: This model is designed for recognizing and predicting ASCII characters from one-hot encoded inputs. For image-based character recognition, you would need a model that can handle image data, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Q: How can I improve the model's performance?
A: Experiment with adjusting the network's architecture (number of layers and neurons), learning rate, and regularization parameter. More advanced techniques could include implementing dropout or exploring different activation functions.
